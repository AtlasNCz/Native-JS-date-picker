# Native-JS-Date-Picker
This is a ver

<!-- <script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script>
<form action="">
	<input type="text" onclick="call.open(this)">
</form>
-->

## Getting Started
You will just need to include the "date-picker.js" file in any html page 
Then you can start using it, It already creates a Date_picker object called date_picker, so all you need to do is assign an onclick event to an element calling the function date_picker.open() with the dom element that you want the output to go as the parameter, if the element you want the output to go is the same one you signed the event you can just pass "this" as the parameter

```
<input type="text" onclick="date_picker.open(this)">
```
