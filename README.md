This is a ver

<!-- <script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script>
<form action="">
	<input type="text" onclick="call.open(this)">
</form>
-->

## Getting Started
Just include "date-picker.js" in your html page <br/>
It creates a Date_picker object called date_picker, all you need to do is to assign an onclick event to an element calling the function "date_picker.open()" with the dom element that you want the output to go as the parameter, if the element you want the output to go is the same one you signed the event you can just pass "this" as the parameter

```
<input type="text" onclick="date_picker.open(this)">
```
